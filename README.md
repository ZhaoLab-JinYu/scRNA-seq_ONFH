# Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals aberrant stromal cells and heterogeneous endothelial cells in alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

Nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling orthopaedic disease that is pathologically characterized by femoral head microvascular dysfunction and bone metabolism disorder. Alcoholism is the main pathogenic factor in nontraumatic ONFH and is responsible for 32.4% - 45.3% of nontraumatic ONFH cases in Asia. Although many hypotheses exist regarding the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced ONFH, the exact pathogenesis has remained unclear.

Here, we analysed femoral head cells from patients with middle- and advanced-stage alcohol-induced ONFH (Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) 3A and 4) by using scRNA-seq. Samples from patients with hip osteoarthritis (HOA) with chronic joint degeneration and femoral neck fracture (FNF) characterized by acute ischaemia and acute inflammatory responses were used as controls. Our data revealed heterogeneous cellular transcriptome characteristics, identified pathogenic endothelial cells, and explored specific cellâ€“cell communication patterns in alcohol-induced ONFH.

Here're codes which were used to conduct analysis and draw figures in this paper: Single-cell transcriptome analysis reveals aberrant stromal cells and heterogeneous endothelial cells in alcohol-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.
